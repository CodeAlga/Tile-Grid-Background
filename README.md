I am a lover of FexBox, but like everyting else the Grid system has its uses and situations.
This small exercies creates a tile sistem with tow diferent backgrounds, both of them fixed
to the main body.

This is more about making the tiles rather than the content in it. Their size in width is
divided by the `grid-template-columns` while the heigh of the tiles is divided with a
css `calc` function.

This can be used as a widget in platforms or diferent backgrounds can be used to mean different
stages.
